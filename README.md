# 🌐 Holberton School Network Project

## 📝 Description
This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of computer networking, including the OSI model, different types of networks, IP addressing, and various networking protocols.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### 🗂️ OSI Model
- What it is
- How many layers it has
- How it is organized

### 🌍 Network Types
- What is a LAN
  - Typical usage
  - Typical geographical size
- What is a WAN
  - Typical usage
  - Typical geographical size
- What is the Internet

### 🏷️ IP Addressing
- What is an IP address
- What are the 2 types of IP address
- What is localhost
- What is a subnet
- Why IPv6 was created

### 🔗 TCP/UDP
- What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP
- What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
- What is a port
- Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
- What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

## 📋 Requirements
### 🖥️ Bash script files
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All Bash script files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 22.04
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Bash scripts must pass shellcheck without any error
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script does
