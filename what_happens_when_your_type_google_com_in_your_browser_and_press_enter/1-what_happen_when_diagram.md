## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **DNS Resolution**
   - Browser initiates DNS query for "www.google.com"
   - Query goes through local cache → OS cache → ISP DNS → Root DNS → TLD DNS → Authoritative DNS
   - Returns IP address to browser

2. **TCP Connection & Firewall**
   - Browser initiates TCP connection on port 443 (HTTPS)
   - Connection must pass through:
     - Local firewall
     - Google's firewall
   - SSL/TLS handshake establishes secure connection

3. **Load Balancer**
   - Request reaches Google's load balancer
   - Load balancer:
     - Checks server health
     - Applies load balancing algorithm
     - Routes to appropriate web server

4. **Web Server**
   - Receives request
   - Handles static content
   - Forwards dynamic content requests to application server

5. **Application Server**
   - Processes business logic
   - Generates dynamic content
   - Manages user sessions
   - Interacts with database

6. **Database**
   - Receives queries from application server
   - Returns requested data
   - Manages data consistency

7. **Response Flow**
   - Database → Application Server: Returns data
   - Application Server → Web Server: Sends generated content
   - Web Server → Load Balancer: Sends complete web page
   - Load Balancer → Browser: Delivers final response
   - Browser renders the page
